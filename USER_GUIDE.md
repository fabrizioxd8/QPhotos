# QPhotos: User Guide

Welcome to QPhotos! This guide will walk you through the main features of the app and help you get started with documenting your fieldwork.

## 1. Setting Up the Server Connection

Before you can upload photos, you need to tell the app where to find your server.

1.  **Open Settings**: Tap the **Settings** icon (the gear) on the main screen.
2.  **Enter Server IP**: In the Settings screen, you will see a field for the **Server IP Address**. Enter the IP address of the computer running the QPhotos Python server (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
3.  **Save**: The IP address is saved automatically as you type.

*Note: You must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your server for uploads to work.*

## 2. Taking and Uploading Photos

QPhotos is designed to make capturing and organizing photos as simple as possible.

### Step 1: Set the Project Name

Before you take a photo, you must set a project name. You have a few options:

-   **Type a Project Name**: Tap on the "Project Name" field and type in the name of your current project.
-   **Use the Last Project**: For convenience, the last project you used is displayed in the top right. Simply tap this text to automatically populate the project name field.
-   **Select from a List**: Tap the dropdown arrow on the "Project Name" field to see a list of projects from the current month and select one.

### Step 2: Capture Photos

-   **From the Camera**: Aim your device and tap the large **shutter button** at the bottom of the screen. A sound will confirm the photo has been taken and added to the upload queue.
-   **From the Gallery**: Tap the **gallery icon** (to the right of the shutter button). This will open your device's gallery, where you can select one or more existing photos to add to the upload queue.

## 3. Managing the Upload Queue

All photos you take or select are added to a background upload queue. This ensures that your photos will be uploaded reliably, even if your network connection is temporarily lost.

-   **Viewing the Queue**: A counter on the main screen shows how many photos are currently pending in the queue (e.g., "10 Photos in Queue"). Tap this text to go to the **Queue Screen**.
-   **The Queue Screen**: This screen shows a list of all photos waiting to be uploaded, along with their current status ("Pending," "Uploading," or "Failed").

## 4. Browsing and Managing Projects

You can easily browse the photos and manage the projects that have already been successfully uploaded to the server.

1.  **Open Projects**: On the main screen, tap the **View Projects** icon (the folder to the left of the shutter button).
2.  **Navigate**: This will open a file explorer that shows your projects organized by month, project, and day. Tap on any folder to navigate deeper.
3.  **View Photos**: When you navigate to a specific day, you will see a gallery of all the photos taken on that day. Tap any photo to open it in a full-screen viewer where you can zoom in and swipe between images.
4.  **Manage Projects**: To rename or delete a project folder, simply **long-press** (tap and hold) on the project's name in the file explorer. A menu will appear with options to "Rename" or "Delete."
