# QPhotos - Complete User Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

**QPhotos** is your professional field photography companion. This guide will help you get started quickly and make the most of all features.

## üì± What is QPhotos?

**QPhotos replaces our old WhatsApp photo sharing system.** Instead of photos getting lost in chat groups, QPhotos automatically organizes all field photos by project and date on our company server.

**Why we built this:**
- WhatsApp photos were disorganized and hard to find
- No professional documentation standards
- Photos would get lost in chat history
- Difficult to locate specific project photos when needed

**What QPhotos does:**
- Automatically organizes photos by project and date
- Adds professional watermarks with project info and timestamps
- Stores everything safely on our company server
- Makes it easy to find any photo from any project

## üîß Initial Setup

1. On your computer, run the Python server by double-clicking `server.py` or running:
   ```
